Low-frequency coefficients cluster near the centre, mid-frequency coefficients occupy the intermediate ring, and high-frequency coefficients are located at the periphery. Steganographic embedding targets the mid-frequency ring to balance robustness and imperceptibility.}}{20}{figure.2.9}%

Spatial rotation by angle $\theta $ rotates the entire magnitude spectrum by the same angle, moving the embedded coefficient from $E$ to $E'$.

The dotted line marks the $5\%$ BER threshold below which error correction coding can typically achieve full recovery.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.13}{\ignorespaces Effect of cropping on block-based DCT embedding. Column~0 (shaded red, left) is removed by the crop. Because the extractor anchors its $8\times 8$ block grid to the top-left corner of the received image, the entire grid shifts by one block position. The extractor reads coefficients from the wrong blocks (marked~?), even though the embedded blocks~E were not themselves removed. This synchronisation failure produces a near-random BER regardless of the signal-level embedding quality.}}{34}{figure.2.13}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.14}{\ignorespaces A typical social media compound attack pipeline applied to a stego-image. Each stage introduces a distinct type of degradation: resizing causes block misalignment and acts as a low-pass filter; JPEG recompression introduces quantisation error in DCT coefficients; format conversion may introduce additional colour-space transformations. The cumulative effect is far more destructive than any single attack alone.}}{36}{figure.2.14}%

The main pipeline (left column) flows top-to-bottom: the encoder $E_\theta $ embeds the secret message into a cover image, the noise layer simulates attacks during training, and the decoder $D_\phi $ recovers the message. Training-side components (right column) provide the message loss $\mathcal {L}_\text {msg}$ and an adversarial discriminator loss $\mathcal {L}_\text {adv}$; the image loss $\mathcal {L}_\text {img}$ (dashed, left) penalises visible distortion between cover and stego-image.}}{42}{figure.2.16}%

Both metrics decrease monotonically with increasing embedding strength. PSNR degrades rapidly even at moderate strengths, while SSIM is more tolerant of small-amplitude, high-frequency embedding signals that preserve structural content. This highlights the complementary nature of the two metrics.}}{49}{figure.2.17}%
